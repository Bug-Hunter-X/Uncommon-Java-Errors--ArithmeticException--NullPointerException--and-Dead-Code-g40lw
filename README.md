This repository demonstrates some less-common but potentially problematic scenarios in Java programming.  It includes examples of:

*   **ArithmeticException:**  Caused by division by zero.
*   **NullPointerException:**  Caused by attempting to access a member of a null object.
*   **Dead Code:** Code that is unreachable because it's placed after an unhandled exception.
*   **Finally Block:**  Illustrates the use of a finally block to ensure resource cleanup regardless of whether an exception occurred.

The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file contains the buggy code, whereas `UncommonErrorSolution.java` provides corrected versions.
